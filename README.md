Terro's Real Estate Agency Data Analysis
Welcome to the Terro's Real Estate Agency Data Analysis project! In this project, we'll be exploring a dataset of housing prices in Boston to understand the factors that influence house prices in a particular locality.

Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to analyze the magnitude of each variable and its effect on the price of a house in a specific locality. We'll perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression analysis to achieve this goal.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains information on various factors affecting house prices in Boston. Here's a brief overview of the attributes:

CRIME_RATE: Per capita crime rate by town
INDUSTRY: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
NOX: Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
AVG_ROOM: Average number of rooms per house
AGE: Proportion of houses built prior to 1940
DISTANCE: Distance from highway (in miles)
TAX: Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town
LSTAT: Percentage lower status of the population
AVG_PRICE: Average value of houses in $1000's
Tasks and Questions to Address
Generate summary statistics for each variable.
Plot a histogram of the AVG_PRICE variable and provide insights.
Compute the covariance matrix and share observations.
Create a correlation matrix and identify the top 3 positively and negatively correlated pairs.
Build a regression model with AVG_PRICE as the dependent variable and LSTAT as the independent variable. Analyze the results.
Build a new regression model with LSTAT and AVG_ROOM as independent variables. Calculate the predicted price for a new house and compare it with the quoted price by the company.
Build a regression model with all variables. Interpret the output.
Select significant variables based on p-values and build another regression model. Interpret the output and compare it with the previous model.
